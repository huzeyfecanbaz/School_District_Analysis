# School_District_Analysis
In this project, PyCitySchools_Challenge_starter_code.ipynb has been used and manipulated in order to get the most accurate result. Throughout the process different resources has been used such as python, pandas library, and jupyter notebook. This analysis gives an accurate opportunity to the school board and district level admins to make decisions of budget and priorities more consciously.

## Overview of the school District Analysis
The purpose of this project was to compare two analysis results after removing dubious scores from Thomas High School. The scores mentioned were present on both math and reading. The conclusion made more cohesive after the step-by-step project via Jupyter Notebook.
In this project, a series of the steps followed and some experience from the Module 4 is used to provide the most accurate and logical code to the audience. The steps followed throughout the process as follows:
- Reading csv file by using pandas library.
- Cleaning and changing necessary data by using loc () function.
- Merge two datasets to generate a new DataFrame for more information.
- Perform calculations with the help of groupby () function.
- Visualize the data with tables and format them via map() method.

## Resources
- Data Source:PyCitySchools_Challenge_starter_code.ipynb
- Software:Python,Pandas Library, Jupiter Notebook.

## Results
Following questions answered in order to exhibit the results. The following pictures will be using to express the results

- How is the district summary affected?
The manipulation in Thomas High School impacted the district summary positively. As it can be seen in the pictures above, even though average math and reading scores are stay still, the % passing math and reading has increased. 

- How is the school summary affected?
As it can be seen in the picture below, the Thomas High School is located in the top 5 schools after the analysis.

- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
The change in ninth graders' math and reading scores impacted the % passing math, % passing reading and % overall passing scores. Those changes can be seen in the following pictures, last three columns is representing % passing math, % passing reading and % overall passing scores. The change in % passing math is from %66.91 to %93.18, % passing reading is from $69.66 to %97.01 and % overall passing scores is %65.07 to %90.63.

- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
	- Math and reading scores by grade
	- Scores by school spending
	- Scores by school size
	- Scores by school type
These terms has not changed at all.

## Summary
As a summary, the summary tables have slightly reducing the average scores but an important change in the percent passing scores including both math and reading passing percentages and overall passing percentage as well by replacing the necessary ninth graders' math and
reading scores from Thomas High School.
